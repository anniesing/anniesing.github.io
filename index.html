          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I believe in the power and the voice, and the Internet has quickly turned into the largest, most easily accessed international soapbox. Developing an influential app can positively change the way our world thinks, which is why I'm excited to contribute my technical skills.

          <h3>Enthusiastic</h3>
          <p>
            I am contagiously enthusiastic and positive about my passions.

        <span>
          <h3>Quick-Learner</h3>
          <p>
            I can pickup anything with a spark of instruction. I have an intrinsic drive to learn, which propels my success.
          </p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h3>Efficient</h3>
          <p>
            I value time-management because it allows me to do everything I want to do. Otherwise, there just aren't enough hours in the day.
          </p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h3>Talented, Driven, Hard-Worker</h3>
          <p>
            I learned how to build full web apps in 9 weeks. I applied to 22 scholarships and received 7 to attend my dream college. I played collegiate volleyball and am 5 foot 1. I tutored students in the subject that I was also taking at the time. They approached me.
          </p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h3>Leader</h3>
          <p>
            I adapt to my surroundings easily, which allows me to relate to others quickly. This ability makes others feel comfortable approaching me, and my natural drive to help others, in combination with my go-getter attitude lends me to being a team leader.
